# CityCare

CityCare is a Python-based civic-tech application designed to help citizens report city issues and simulate how municipal authorities manage and resolve them.

The application allows users to report problems like potholes, water leakage, and infrastructure issues, track their status history, and provide feedback after resolution.

At its current stage, CityCare functions as a prototype, using an automated AI-assisted system to review and resolve issues, without real municipal integration.

 Features

📝 Report city issues by attaching images (e.g., potholes, leakages, sanitation problems, etc.)

📍 City / location-based issue records

🕒 Issue history tracking:

Reported time

Review time

Resolution time


🤖 Automated issue review & resolution (simulated authority logic)

⭐ Feedback system after issue resolution

🖥️ Simple and clear Python-based interface


---

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Application Type: Python-based application

Data Handling: Python data structures / JSON

Automation Logic: Rule-based + AI-assisted logic

AI Assistance: Used during development (see disclosure below)

🧠 How It Works

1. User reports a city issue through the application


2. The issue is stored with timestamps


3. An automated system reviews the issue details


4. The system updates the issue status:

Reported

Under Review

Resolved



5. Users can view the complete issue history


6. After resolution, users can submit feedback



This automated flow simulates municipal issue handling for demonstration purposes.

🏛️ Municipal Integration Status

❌ No live municipal or government integration

✅ Designed as a proof of concept

✅ Workflow mirrors real-world civic issue management systems



---

🤖 AI Usage Disclosure (Important)

AI tools were used during development to:

Assist in designing issue review and resolution logic

Help structure application workflows

Improve clarity of user interaction and documentation

Speed up learning and development


All system behavior, limitations, and scope were intentionally defined and implemented to demonstrate understanding.
